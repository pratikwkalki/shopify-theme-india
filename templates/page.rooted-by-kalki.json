centuries-old tradition of block printing since the 12th century. While some believe this art was borrowed from China, our local artisans added their inputs over time in the form of newer colours and patterns. Though the process of hand block printing has been replaced with faster screen printing, you will still find Indigenous workshops upholding this cultural tradition. A lot of love and labour goes into the process of block printing to present the finest hand block print <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kalkifashion.com\/in\/ethnic\/men-s-kurta-set.html\">kurta set<\/a>.

It starts with skilled wood carvers carving the outline block in a tedious process. While simple designs require three blocks, the craftsmen might need around 30 blocks to create detailed patterns on a block print kurta set. These blocks are dipped in colours either fully or partially to create beautiful patterns on a handblock print kurta. The fabric also undergoes washing and drying before being stamped with the most aesthetic prints by master craftsmen. When choosing the colours for block prints, some prefer vegetable dyes, which render the brightest shades, whereas others stick to easy-to-mix pigment dyes. The placement of handblocks also has a vital role in elevating the visuals of the block print <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kalkifashion.com\/in\/mens.html\">kurta for men<\/a>.<\/p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"justify\">Types of Block Printed Men's Clothing<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"justify\">Step out in style wearing a block-print kurta for men.
