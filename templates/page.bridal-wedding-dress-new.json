These sarees come in various styles, fabrics and designs and\n    are adorned with opulent embellishments, and intricate embroideries making every bride feel like royalty on her\n    special day.<\/p>\n<h2>Factors To Consider While Choosing A Wedding Dress<\/h2>\n<p>Any young lady dreams of a perfect wedding dress since her teens. That fantasy dress needs to be perfect,\n    coordinated, and comfortable as per the occasion, venue, budget, and your own personality. Let’s have a look at a\n    few things to keep in mind before choosing a dream wedding dress.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Season<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The season when you are getting hitched is significant in choosing the fabric, style, and colour of your wedding\n    outfit. During winters brides can go for darker and thicker varieties in silk, banarasi or velvet. For summer or\n    spring weddings, the sheer and cool varieties in organza, net and chiffon can take over. So, whether you are a\n    spring lady or winter bride; you can choose the shades, design and layers of your bridal dress accordingly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Budget<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you don’t swear by that OTT and elaborate look, a budget wedding outfit can really work for you. You can set a\n    budget and go about your dream attire accordingly. There are designs that are affordable and yet fall in the whole\n    traditional and heavy spectrum of wedding fashion. Creating, planning and managing your budget will make you fall in\n    love with your statement piece.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Research<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your wedding dress is way beyond just a garment. It’s a memory-driven, classic and timeless number that is going to\n    make you nostalgic for the rest of your life. We suggest you go about your wedding day shopping whole-heartedly and\n    invest a good amount of time looking for the latest and most suitable pick. After shortlisting, you can get your\n    dream couture customized with a personal touch.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Venue & Theme<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are essential in determining the style and design you need for your wedding day. You can match the theme and\n    ambience of the venue by choosing classic, romantic, fantasy, ethnic, royal, and harmonious designs.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Fabric<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Figuring out the right fabric is an important aspect which many brides tend to ignore. All through your wedding,\n    stage photographs and pheras, you need to feel comfortable and feel at ease with your bridal wedding dress. For that\n    matter, the right kind of fabric for the wedding dress needs to be considered.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Not Too Early Not Too Late<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Many wedding dresses take months to be produced with exact measurements, customization, and style specifications. So,\n    you need to keep buffer time in hand for further alterations and accessorizing. On the other hand, if you have a\n    long courtship like 6 months or a year, the style may go out of fashion. So, don’t plan it months in advance. Try to\n    stay close to your ‘save the date’.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>Fit and Size Matters<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Forget the numbers when it comes to buying the best wedding dress for your nuptials. Don’t just insist on the size\n    that you usually wear. Your T-shirt or <a href=\"collections\/kurtis\" title=\"Kurtis\">kurti<\/a> size might not be the\n    exact size you need for your wedding couture. To sum it up, we would like to suggest a straight ‘try and buy’ and go\n    for the right fit rather than the right size. After all, size is just a number and it’s the right fit that you need.\n<\/p>\n<h2>How to Style Wedding Dresses?<\/h2>\n<p>A wedding is an auspicious day in every woman’s life. To make this day memorable and unique, style your wedding dress\n    using the most innovative ideas.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>For Gowns<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Choose a bright-coloured gown with heavy embellishments. You can use a dupatta in different styles to highlight the\n    ethnic feel of Indian weddings.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>For A-Line Dress<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pick a graceful A-line dress to attend a wedding, which fits at the waistline and enhances your body curves. One can\n    add an embroidered belt tied at the sides with hanging tassels.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3>For Wedding Lehenga Choli<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To style a <a href=\"collections\/ethnic-wedding-lehengas\" title=\"Wedding Lehengas\">wedding lehenga choli<\/a>, opt for\n    stamen jewellery and accessories that complement the outfit’s design and colour. Experiment with different draping\n    styles for the dupatta to add an elegant touch and complete the bridal look with stunning hairstyles and flawless\n    makeup.<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <h3> For Wedding Sarees<\/h3>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kalkifashion.com\/in\/sarees\/wedding-sarees.html\" title=\"wedding saree\">wedding saree<\/a>,\n    explore various styles such as front pallu, lehenga style, dhoti style, nauvari style and more. Enhance the bridal\n    look with a heavily embellished dupatta to create a stunning impact and exude the perfect wedding vibes. To\n    complement the look, choose exquisite jewellery pieces like a <a href=\"collections\/ethnic-temple-jewellery\"\n        title=\"Temple Jewellery\">temple jewellery<\/a> necklace, or kundan choker set. Add jhumkas and maang tikka to\n    enhance the overall look.
