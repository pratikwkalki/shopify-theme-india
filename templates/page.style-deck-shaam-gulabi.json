Why would a man choose to wear anything pink? Let’s have a picture and view of pink in the past and how and why the<\/li><\/ol>","read-more-text":"<ol><li><\/li><li>fashion-forward and modern men are embracing the so-called girly shade. Pink has acquired its feminine connotations only in the recent past. But the notion that it is too bright and bubbly didn’t hold any importance if we peep into the history. Going back to the 18th century, the girls, boys, men, and women used to wear pink and even blue colors uniformly. Infact pink was even considered to be a masculine color. Pink was considered ardent, attractive, passionate, and more active which perfectly fitted into the traits of men. So, let’s break the shackles and the gendering of pink as we talk about the good, pretty and positive color being accepted and flaunted by new-age men and grooms who have stopped associating pink with gender and beliefs. Today they are proudly responding to the so-called feminine, baby, girlie color and proving that the pink is very manly.<\/li><li>The Kapsule comprises the most anticipated collections, one that’s luxury and special edition, yet also accessible.Metallic & Summer Sequins, the highlightof the collection is all set to bring the party spirit back to the fashion lanes. Watch Now!<\/li><li>Uber confident men are carrying off pink and are showing off their dandy boy or dapper man image through their choice of pink outfits, accessories, shoes and even stoles and dupattas. Let’s rope in Bollywood’s macho men Akshay Kumar, Emraan Hashmi, Varun Dhawan, Ranveer Singh and Hrithik Roshan. They are sporting more than a dash of pink with their lowers, lounge sets, co-ord sets, jacket, jeans, caps, hoodies, and sweaters. Pink is there on the menswear racks for the grooms for their sangeet, haldi and even main wedding day events. Transcending beyond the fairer sex, pink is used extensively by the grooms and groomsmen to brighten things up. The simple salmon cotton kurta, floral printed coral Nehru jacket, abstract motif strawberry pink stole, rouge juttis and mojaris, the rosewood pink safa or the flamingo sherwani dupatta are upping the modern men’s ante and helping them scream for attention. Not just weddings or ramps, men are stepping out in pink for their routine work, offices and even holidays on hills and beaches. Sporting pink chappals, hats, waist bags or waist bags- men today are aware of the usage of this vibrant hue.<\/li><li>TWe are totally loving this new mind-set of men that a bright color like pink is just not a women’s territory. Infact pink is offering a broad outlook to the new generation of men for fashion and style statements. And above all, what matters more than the fashion momentum is the choice, comfort and self-confidence.<\/li><\/ol>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/sham_gulabi_blog.webp"}}},"order":["main","product_breadcrumb_new_qgqgAF","style_deck_image_with_text_9LyDNH","style_deck_multi_image_with_text_cH4T3Q","fireworks_section_qkHERh","style_deck_appointment_8DUGyN","style_deck_tips_GiqrjU"]}
